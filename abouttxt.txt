Welcome to ShiftGen, the ultimate solution for seamless shift scheduling.
I've developed an app that streamlines shift creation for delivery drivers using Python.

Key Features:

* Simple Shift Allocation:
Designate morning, afternoon, and evening shifts effortlessly by specifying
the required number of workers for each slot.

* Fairness Level Control:
Set a fairness level to ensure equitable distribution of shifts.
This feature prevents excessive discrepancies between the most and least assigned shifts.

* User-Friendly:
Just click and run, set the parameters and you are ready to go!

* Efficient Optimization:
Optimize schedules based on driver availability and workload, guaranteeing both fairness and efficiency.

Say goodbye to manual scheduling challenges and welcome a new era
of automated, fair, and optimized shift management with ShiftGen.
