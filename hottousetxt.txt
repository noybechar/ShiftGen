Before You Begin:

*Ensure that all your CSV data is in the "Datacsv" folder. Each file should be a single word of a specific
length (e.g., "Noy Bechar" becomes "noyb" or "noy"), with V's and X's indicating worker availability.
*Make sure the "output.csv" file is empty.

1) Launch the app.

2) Select the worker's priority: High, Medium, or Low.
(Higher-priority workers are more likely to receive their requested shifts.)

3) Enter the worker's name in the box below, then press the "ENTER" key on your keyboard.

4) Repeat this process for all workers.
*Ensure accurate names that match the CSV file in the "Datacsv" folder.
*A worker cannot get 3 shifts in a single day!

5) Specify the "Fairness level" (ranging from 0 to 20, where 0 is the fairest).
By choosing a number, the system will limit shifts differences to the provided fairness level.
NOTE:
* Lower fairness levels require more calculations. If the program becomes
unresponsive, wait for processing to complete.
* If the system can't find a suitable arrangement, it will automatically increase the fairness level.

6) Set the desired number of Morning, Afternoon, and Evening Workers for each shift throughout the week.

7) Click the "RANDOMIZE" button and wait.

8) Get the output CSV file from the directory where the app is.
